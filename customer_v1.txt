while loading customer app, there is no api(so I added fixed value)

-- vendor app
To Re-enable Login Later:  splash.vm.dart
When your backend is properly configured with a manager assigned to a vendor, simply:
Remove the new code (lines 89-93)
Uncomment the original code (lines 95-126)
Now you can see the main page UI without needing to login! 🎉
